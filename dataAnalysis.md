Exploratory Data Analysis
We approached our data analysis by circling back to a question asked while getting the data: “How is the range of education levels so diverse throughout wards?” We created a pivot table that compares the average income of wards and the highest levels of education. 
We created a new table and deleted all rows that would not be of use. Following “How to Transpose Data to Google Sheets” by Spreadsheet Point on YouTube, we copied my data from the new set, then hovered the mouse over “Paste special” and selected “Transposed”. This flips the sheet, making it easier to analyze with a pivot table.
The new chart was much easier to read;  however, I wanted to focus on the main levels of education present. I used =SUM under each row and compared the highest sums, making a new chart. We also deleted anything that repeated. The sums of the top 7 levels were all above 90,000.

Making the Pivot Table
Our first step was setting the rows of the pivot tables to be our wards (yellow). Since we are comparing several levels of study to the average income, we ordered the income (purple)  before the values pertaining to education (green). We ordered the wards from highest to lowest based on their average total income. The bottom row of the pivot table depicts the average total income across wards, and the average recipients at a level of education.

Why did you choose these variables in particular?
Our most promising initial observations often regarded the nuance of income and education. As University students, we are directly affected by the support given to postsecondary students. We hoped to see a clear relation between the average income of the wards to the highest levels of education most prevalent, we chose the clearest category regarding income within the characteristics that will support our potential story.

Does a particular number or statistic stand out?
In Ward 1, the ward with the highest average total income in 2020, the ratio of bachelor's degree to no certificate, diploma, or degree is quite substantial, being 19,240 to 2,550. The top two wards greatly exceeded the averages of Bachelor’s degree and master’s degree recipients.

What did you learn? What's the potential story here?
There is a relation between the highest level of education received and the average income of wards. Our story would address where the educational support of wards fails and where they exceed. If the higher the income relates to the higher of education, what is put in place to provide additional support for those in pursuit of a higher level? Do the residents of these wards feel supported? 

Which variables and numbers would warrant further investigation (next step)?
The pivot table does not include the number of recipients in each ward, which affects the results greatly. This is an element that would be beneficial  to the validity of our story as we continue to explore the data.
It would also be important for us to explore other levels of education, outside of the main 7. We cut the rest for efficiency and cleanliness of the data; however, there are large demographics removed because of this.
