## Exploratory Data Analysis: How Much Does Education Really Impact Income?

Using a dataset gathered by Statistics Canada and provided by the City of Ottawa, we used pivot tables and exploratory charts to identify a potential relationship between an Ottawa ward’s average level of education and its average level of income.

### Key Takeaways and Observations

We found that some wards had a high rate of post-secondary education, such as ward 1 (Orleans East-Cumberland) with 19,240 people holding a bachelor’s degree versus 2,550 people with no post-secondary education at all. It’s also worth noting that this ward had the highest average income in 2020. We believe there is a story behind this significant correlation.
