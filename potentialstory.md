For our story, we wanted to focus on the income versus education level of the different wards across Ottawa to understand if there's a correlation between people's education level and salary and find potential patterns within the wards. In order to tell this story, we would first need the cleaned dataset to show people where our data is coming from before we begin the story. Accompanying the data, we could also include a visual element such as a scatter plot diagram, a grouped bar chart, or even create a map of Ottawa showing the education or income levels using Google My Maps. By providing readers with additional ways to understand the data can further help them understand the story. Additionally, to tell this story we would need to understand more in depth about the different wards and factors in different circumstances. This could possibly include research on housing costs, possible transportation issues, population ages, or job opportunities. By taking note of these factors, we could create a more in depth analysis. Finally, interviews from people in different areas would be very beneficial. Interviewing a resident from a lower-income ward versus someone from a higher-income ward about their education or job opportunities in the area can create a more credible story for readers.
