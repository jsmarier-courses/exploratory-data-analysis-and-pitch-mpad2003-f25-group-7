Before beginning our data analysis, we must first assess if the data is reliable before making claims and sharing facts. A VIMO analysis checks if the data is valid, invalid, missing, or contains outliers. For the sake of our analysis, I will only be focusing on column B, C, and D, which shows the total numbers and percentages in the whole city of Ottawa, ward 1 Orléans East-Cumberland, and ward 2 Orléans West-Innes.

To identify if the data is valid, I first checked to make sure the data was formatted correctly and valid. For instance, if the data characteristic has to do with income, it will often use a ($) symbol indicating the number represents a certain amount of money in Canadian currency. Same thing If it has a (%), then they are looking for a percentage of the population. Using this information, I carefully went through the data to make sure it follows the correct formats and nothing looks out of the ordinary. 

For example, I made sure “Composition of total income in 2020 of the population aged 15 years and over in private households (%) - 25% sample data” represents valid percentages as all the numbers should between 0-100:

Additionally, I made sure there were no negative numbers, the percentages made mathematical sense, and there were no random data, for example text, put into the boxes. I also checked for possible missing data/empty boxes and outliers by making sure there was no super high, low, or unrealistic data. I found that some numbers, such as population or currency numbers, may be off by a couple numbers, but that is just because the census rounds numbers to the closest 5. That said, I would still consider this as valid data.
For example “Secondary (high) school diploma or equivalency certificate for the population aged 25 to 64 years in private households” ends with either 0 or 5:

In conclusion, I found that the 2021 census dataset has no outliers, missing data or invalid data, therefore is valid and reliable enough to continue our analysis.
